# 👋 Hey there, I'm StarCoder's


I'm a self-taught developer learning Python, CLI tools, automation, and web development from scratch. I work on a low-RAM machine and still 
get things done - because passion > hardware 💪

This is my personal developer website built using just HTML and CSS. It showcase my current Python projects and tools as i learn and grow in the programming world.
